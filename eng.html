                <p>From 20th to 27th may 2023 in boarding school lived our German friends as a port of our student exchange. They came to us from Wuppertal to get to know our cities and history. The whole enterprise is organized as a part of project "Zachować pamięć". As students of class II in ZSTI gliwice we committed ourselves to accompany and help them in sightseeing. This international project will allow us to improve our German language, make a new friends and take a look at other pepole's opinion on our country. Such international cooperation will teach us participants tolerance and respect for the history of our countries.

            <p>The first day was based on getting to know the girls who visited us. We all met together in front of our school's dormitory building, none of us knew what to expect. The plan for today was to visit Villa Caro and take part in a field game that our teachers had prepared. When everyone arrived, our common superiors decided that we would take our first cult photo. Later we were to divide into groups, each team was to consist of 3 boys and 3 girls. Once we were all matched up, the time to get acquainted with the girls began. We quietly made our way to our final destination, which was the museum. Many of us had not visited this place before, we were surprised by the nature of the place. We watched the local specific paintings and other souvenirs that were displayed there. It was time for a field game, together in groups we covered the route that our ladies had designed. We finished our struggle in the market square at the Neptune fountain, then headed to the school to see off our new friends , in anticipation of the next day's sightseeing

            <p>That day as any other started with our meeting with German group. Our trip was planned at 7.45 and so we left then. In bus we get to know each others musical taste. That's how we spent hours, till we finally arrived our destiantion. Our trip started from sightseeing Wroclaw's Sky Tower and gallery. Some of us before heading to one of the highest sightseeing point in Poland have choosed to eat something. Nourished by well-balanced meal we headed to the Tower. The view was incredible. Almost all the city was in the range of our sight. Unfortunately this experience wasn't lasting long and we had to go down by the elevator. After quick break and exchanging our impressions, we went on sightseeing the city.</p>

            <p>We were devided into polish group and german group, each of groups got a guide. Trip was very interesting, and we were told a lot of interesting historic facts about the city. At the end of our journey was a marketplace, where we could freely move around and sightsee. After longer period of time we got together and went to our last stop during trip and it was the "Hall of the century". On the way, we saw a bus with Legia Warsaw's basketball players, they were very contented with cheering which we gave them. At the place as like as on the marketplace we got free hand about moving around and we had an occasion to go sightsee that place. It wasn't lasting too long since our teachers told us, that we had to go back.</p>

            <p>It is the third day with our german friends . Today we went with them to a place known for a lot of crimes,
                commited by Germans on Jews. We were divided into two groups: German and Polish.
                It took us four hours to explore the entire camp. We were all traumatized, when we saw all those
                extermination sites  and
                what unacceptable things can be done to a human. Our moods were improved by a delicious dinner. Nourished
                and ready to go
                we went to the last thing that awaited us, which was a workshop entilted  “The Eleventh. dont be
                indifferent”.
                The lady talked about the fact, that Auschwitz did not happen suddenly, but was made by a sequence of events, that added to it
                and no one responded to them. She also showed us how easily a stereotype turns into a prejudice, and
                next into 
                discrimination. It also showed how people discriminate against each other through the prism of one thing. The workshops did not last
                 long and we had to go home.

            <p>The next day, next adventure. In today's plan was guide tour around second concentration camp located in Brzezinka. 
                It was an experience that exhausted us physically and mentally. The conditions in which the prisoners lived in this camp were unhuman.
                The suffering they felt is unimaginable to human mind. After a long time, our journey through the camp has come to an end.
                Our plan's considered a trip to Katowice, but the fatigue and sadness coming from the camp have overcame our German friends.

            <p>One before last day of our student exchange.
Our today's target was to visit a Krakow, specifially a tour of Kazimierz, the district where the Jews live.
We were split to two groups devided by country. Every group had their own guide.
During this time we visited many interesting places especially the synagogues.
After the introductory tour of Kazimierz, the time came to go eat something.
Most of us went to try the famous casseroles in Krakow. They were delicious.
Our last attraction was a Jewisch Museum ,,Galicja", where we had workshops ,,From stereotype to discrimination", which where very similar to these in Oświęcim.
After the workshops we had a meeting with Lida Maksymowicz, that have survived the Auschwitz-Birkenau and she told us her story from her life.
The story of Lidia Maksymowicz was very tragic and exciting in the same time, which moved most of us to tears.
At the end of this day we come back to our lovely city like everyday.
